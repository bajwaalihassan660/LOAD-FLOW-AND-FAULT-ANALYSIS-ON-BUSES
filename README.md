# LOAD-FLOW-AND-FAULT-ANALYSIS-ON-BUSES
LOAD FLOW AND FAULT ANALYSIS ON BUSES USING MATLAB AND PSSE
I conducted load flow and fault analysis using MATLAB and PSS/E (Power System Simulation for Engineering). This project involved analyzing and simulating electrical power systems to determine steady-state conditions (load flow analysis) and transient conditions during faults (fault analysis). Using MATLAB and PSS/E, I modeled power systems, performed calculations, and interpreted results to optimize system performance and reliability.
